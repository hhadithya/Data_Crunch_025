## ðŸŒŸ Key Innovations

1. **Geospatial Group Forecasting**  
   - 23 region-specific models based on latitude/longitude clusters  
   - Shared architecture with group-wise normalization

2. **Hybrid Prediction System**  
   - Combines deep learning patterns with physical constraints  
   - Integrates seasonal baselines and noise-controlled projections

3. **Agricultural-Focused Features**  
   - Wind impact vectors (North/East components)  
   - Dry spell duration tracking  
   - Clear sky radiation benchmarks
